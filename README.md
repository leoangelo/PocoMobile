# Notes

This fork was developed to create Poco frameworks that run at the latest Xcode and iOS versions (as of writing Xcode 6 and iOS 8). In particular, 64-bit architecture has been added. 

As for the Poco libraries included: 
- Foundation
- Net
- Utils
- Data and SQLite
- XML

The list is customizable of course.

Also unfortunately, the version of Poco this fork uses is currently 1.4.6. Will try to upgrade when I have time.

# Building Poco for iOS

Run the `Build-iOS.sh` script, and optionally the `Build-iOS-Framework.sh` script if you want to have a Framework.
